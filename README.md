# Management-Data

## Description

In the event that I become a business owner, I want to be able to organize and store the information regarding my company and employees. Thus, I set out to create an application that could intake the information I submit, and upload it to various tables and databases for me to access later. Through creating this application, I have started to gain a much better understanding of inquirer, how to use asynch and await in javascript, and begun to work with sql in real world applications. I'm hoping through the new skills I have learned that I will soon be able to organize and store information off of other databases I have not created. Then I will be able to make application for others to use as well.

## Installation

Install node.js on your VSC, and then download inquirer and mysql2 as dependencies.

## Usage

The individual with this application will run node index.js on their terminal, and will be presented with various options to view, upload, and update data. To begin, they will click on "add department" to add the various departments to their company. They will then click on "add role" to add the various jobs that their employees work as under the company. Finally, they will "add employee" to add the information for each of the people hired. At any point if a new department, role, or employee joins the company, they will follow this same procedure. If instead the user just wants to view the data, they can do so by clicking "view all departments", "view all roles", or "view all employees", and the saved data in the tables will be displayed in the terminal. If a worker changes their role at the company, just click "update employee role" to change their job title. Once done, all the user has to do is click "quit" to exit.
